-  get image to work - done
- add styling - sort of 
- fix image size 
- add new meme button


difficult:
- add home page that prompts to select a category of meme. 
preset list of categories:
random meme
political meme
crypto meme
dog meme
cat meme

create app route for each category
and make buttons to link to each category. (hardcoded for now till i learn how to do it dynamically)

extra difficult: 
- add auth and login page (using)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71EU8gnZqZQ

maybe impossible:
- add a database to store the favourite memes (pic and subreddit)
using sql 

- add favourite
(favourite meme button meme page, then adds image and text to a list of favourite memes on favourite page)
